# Elongate
Making URL's longer and harder (to read) since 2k17.

## About
Ever wanted to make your URL's longer?

Look no further.

I gotchu fam.

## Why?
Idk. I just wanted to play with sails.js

## Disclaimer
No this doesn't expand links like bit.ly, goo.gl or other shorteners.

Elongate literally just makes your links uglier, longer and harder (to read).

## How to use
`git clone https://github.com/Kaioru/elongate && cd elongate`

`npm install -g sails`

`sails lift`

And then head to `localhost:1337` and start elongating your urls.

## Contributing
Elongate is a quick and dirty project I randomly whipped up.

The code isn't the prettiest.

But feel free to pr and contribute if you like. :heart:
